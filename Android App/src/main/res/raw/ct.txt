Because non-melanoma skin cancer rarely spreads, a biopsy is often the only test needed to diagnose and find out the stage, or extent, of cancer. A biopsy is the removal of a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope. During this procedure, the suspected skin lesion is removed, usually after a local anesthetic numbs the area. The doctor also often removes an area of healthy tissue around the lesion, which is called the margin.

The sample removed during the biopsy is then analyzed by a pathologist who determines if it is a skin cancer. A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in interpreting laboratory tests and evaluating cells, tissues, and organs to diagnose disease.

Your doctor will review the results of the biopsy with you. No further treatment beyond the biopsy may be necessary if the entire cancer was removed. However, if cancer cells were found in the margins of the removed tissue, additional treatment will usually be recommended.
