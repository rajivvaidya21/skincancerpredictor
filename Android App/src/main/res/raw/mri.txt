An MRI is a type of scan that creates pictures using magnetism and radio waves. MRI scans produce pictures from angles all around the body and show up soft tissues very clearly.

MRI stands for magnetic resonance imaging. The scan takes between 15 and 90 minutes.

Why you have it?

Your doctor might send you for an MRI scan to see if your cancer has spread to the nearby lymph nodes or another part of the body.

An MRI scan can also help show up how cancer might be affecting nearby structures such as the nerves. Itâ€™s particularly useful for non melanoma skin cancer that has affected places like the eye or salivary glands.
