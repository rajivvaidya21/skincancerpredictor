This module is designed to accept requests from the server, process input images, and predict the type of skin cancer, along with the probability of its presence. The model is trained to recognize several skin cancer types, including 'Actinic keratoses', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Benign keratosis', 'Dermatofibroma', 'Melanocytic nevi', 'Melanoma', and 'Vascular lesions'. However, the modelâ€™s accuracy is not flawless, as it was trained on limited hardware.
